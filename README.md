# Pase Transitions

This repository explores the behavior of spin chain systems, with a focus on analyzing phase transitions under various conditions and topologies.

Specifically, I investigate:

- Different configurations and interaction regimes within spin chains

- How topology affects the critical behavior of the system

- The emergence of chaotic dynamics in large spin systems under specific regimes

The goal of this project is to provide insights into the complex, collective behavior of quantum systems and their transitions between ordered and disordered phases.
